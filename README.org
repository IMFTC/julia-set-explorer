  (aka 'pretending there aren't enough of these applications yet!')

  [[https://github.com/IMFTC/julia-set-explorer/raw/master/docs/screenshot.png]]

  A Julia set explorer written in C using gtk+.
  For now the focus is the well known function f(z) = z^2 + c.

** *WARNING:* At this stage there is NO serious code here.

   So far it's just a sandbox for testing the very basic building
   blocks of a possible application.

** Goals:

   - Be fast!
     - use mirroring to reduce calculations whenever possible
     - use caching (uses a lot of memory, only meaningful in some
       cases)
     - use multithreading where possible (and sensible)
     - provide functions for operating on any plain RGB pixel buffer
       in memory
   - Good user experience
     - Create a UI for adjusting the value of c, the max. number of
       iterations, etc.
     - Allow easy navigation inside the Julia set
   - Meta
     - Use the meson build system

** Status

   - So far everything in the code is based on the assumption that the
     point (0,0) of the complex plane is always at the center of the
     view, so the user can not position the view yet. The reason for
     this major simplification is that it allows mirroring of half of
     the picture and efficient caching without using multiple tiles or
     the like. Allowing to center the view at arbitrary positions will
     be the next big step once the basics are working.
