* julia-set-explorer
  (aka 'pretending there aren't enough of these applications yet!')

  A Julia set explorer written in C using gtk+.
  For now the focus is the well known function f(z) = z^2 + c.

** *WARNING:* At this stage there is NO serious code here.
   So far it's just a sandbox for testing the very basic building
   blocks of a possible application.

** Goals:
   - Be fast!
     - use mirroring to reduce calculations whenever possible
     - use caching (uses a lot of memory, only meaningful in some
       cases)
     - use multithreading where possible (and sensible)
   - Good user experience
     - Create a UI for adjusting the value of c, the max. number of
       iterations, etc.
     - Allow easy navigation inside the Julia set
   - Meta
     - Use the meson build system
