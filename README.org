* julia-set-explorer

  [[https://github.com/IMFTC/julia-set-explorer/raw/master/docs/screenshot.png]]

  A Julia set explorer for Linux written in C using gtk+.
  For now the focus is the well known function f(z) = z^2 + c.

** Goals:

   - Be fast!
     - Use mirroring to reduce calculations whenever possible
     - Use caching (uses a lot of memory, only meaningful in some
       cases)
     - Use multithreading where possible (and sensible)
     - Provide functions for operating on any plain RGB pixel buffer
       in memory
   - Good user experience
     - Create a UI for adjusting the value of c, the max. number of
       iterations, etc.
     - Allow easy navigation inside the Julia set
   - Meta
     - Use the meson build system

** Status

   For now all code is based on the assumption that the point (0,0)
   of the complex plane is always fixed at the center of the
   view. The reason for this major simplification is that it allows
   mirroring of half of the picture and efficient caching without
   using multiple tiles or the like.

   Allowing to center the view at arbitrary positions will be the next
   big step once the basics are working.

** Building

   Currently only the [[http://mesonbuild.com/][meson]] build system is supported. Compile and
   run the binary (jse) with:
   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
   $ meson builddir
   $ cd builddir
   $ ninja
   $ ./jse
   #+END_SRC

** Debugging

   The G_MESSAGES_DEBUG variable can be set to see all debug messages:
   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
   $ G_MESSAGES_DEBUG=all ./jse
   #+END_SRC
