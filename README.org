* julia-set-explorer

  [[https://github.com/IMFTC/julia-set-explorer/raw/master/docs/screenshot.jpg]]

  A Julia set explorer for Linux written in C using gtk+.
  For now the focus is the well known function f(z) = z^2 + c.

** Goals:

   - Be fast!
     - Use mirroring to reduce calculations whenever possible
     - Use caching (uses a lot of memory, only meaningful in some
       cases)
     - Use multithreading where possible (and sensible)
     - Provide functions for operating on any plain RGB pixel buffer
       in memory
   - Good user experience
     - Create a UI for adjusting the value of c, the max. number of
       iterations, etc.
     - Allow easy navigation inside the Julia set
   - Meta
     - Use the meson build system

** Status

   The current code is experimental and badly organized as I'm mostly
   still playing around to learn all the basics and gather ideas on
   how to achieve certain things. You will also encounter warnings
   coming from programming mistakes that haven't been fixed yet ;)

   But the basics are already working, such as:
   - setting the constant c, max. number of iterations, and center of view from the UI
   - animated transitions for zooming

** Building

   Currently only the [[http://mesonbuild.com/][meson]] build system is supported. Compile and
   run the binary (jse) with:
   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
   $ meson --buildtype=release builddir
   $ cd builddir
   $ ninja
   $ ./jse
   #+END_SRC

** Debugging

   The G_MESSAGES_DEBUG variable can be set to see all debug messages:
   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
   $ G_MESSAGES_DEBUG=all ./jse
   #+END_SRC
